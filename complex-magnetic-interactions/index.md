# Complex Magnetic Interactions

## Issues

Data can be encoded in nanomagnetic devices through the introduction of an external or localized magnetic fields. This data can then be processed through the transferral of magnetic orientation to adjacent magnetic components. [1][1] While this interaction may be obvious between two components, they become considerably more complicated as the size of the system increases. For instance, a magnetic component that is between other components will fall into the orientation with least resistance, but the system needs to be arranged so that the relaxed state is predictable and reproducible at scale. [2][2]

Scenarios like this need to considered thoroughly when designing NML devices, and the resulting designs will ultimately become quite complex. Furthermore, these interactions are not analogous to the processes that those who design semiconductor circuits may be accustomed to. For these reasons, adoption of nanomagnetic logic devices may be hampered by a reluctance to shift to a new and complicated model.

## Solutions

Alleviating these complexities will require a multi-faceted approach involving tooling, education, and strategic partnerships within the industry. [3][3] Developing software tools for design and virtual prototyping can help abstract away the internal complexities of the system while allowing designers to simulate individual components and verify their functionality. [4][4] These tools will then need to be easily available to foster the development of an NML design community, and the internal processes that they abstract will need to be thoroughly documented. This will, in turn, support the second facet â€” education. Lastly, strategic partnerships with companies and universities that are deeply involved with integrated circuit development will be paramount in disseminating the information and tools necessary to maximize adoption and dispel the perceived complexity of NML devices.

## Roadmap

To simplify the development of nanomagnetic logic devices and facilitate their adoption, we plan to:

1. Develop software tools to abstract complexities away from the designer
2. Provide a platform to verify the viability of designs before they are manufactured
3. Document recommended design patterns for foundational computational components
4. Distribute information and tools freely in the community to remove barriers to adoption
5. Form partnerships with institutions within the semiconductor design space to more effectively evangelize our technology.
