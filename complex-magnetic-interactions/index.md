# Complex Magnetic Interactions

## Issues

Data can be encoded in nanomagnetic devices through the introduction of an external or localized magnetic fields. This data can then be processed through the transferral of magnetic orientation to adjacent magnetic components. While this interaction may be obvious between two components, they become considerably more complicated as the size of the system increases. For instance, a magnetic component that is between other components will fall into the orientation with least resistance, but the system needs to be arranged so that the relaxed state is predictable and reproducible.

Scenarios like this need to considered thoroughly when designing NML devices, and the resulting designs will utlimately become quite complex. Furthermore, these interactions are not analogous to the processes that those who design semiconuctor circuits may be accustomed to. For these reasons, adoption of nanomagnetic logic devices may be hampered by a reluctance to shift to a new and complicated model.

## Solutions

Alleviating these complexities will require a multi-faceted approach involing tooling, education, and strategic partnerships within the industry. Developing software tools for design and virtual prototyping can help abstract away the internal complexities of the system while allowing designers to simulate individual components and verify their functionality. These these tools will then need to be easily available to foster the development of an NML design community, and the internal processes that they abstract will need to be thoroughly documented, which in turn will support the second facet -- education. Lastly, strategic partnerships with companies and universities that are deeply involved with integrated circuit development will be paramount in disseminating the information and tools necessary to maximimize adoption and dispel the percieved complexity of NML devices.
