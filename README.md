# Addressing NML Challenges

Nanomagnetic Logic (NML) devices saw a surge in popularity and then a stark decline in interest in the early 2010s. While there are many non-technical reasons for this, there were also some critical challenges that the technology needed to overcome before becoming a serious contender in the microprocessor market. Our team at Aerware Technology has identified six major challenges, summarized their current state, and provided solutions for each hurdle. Some of these issues have since been solved by other researchers in the field, and we have herein proposed solutions for those that remain.
