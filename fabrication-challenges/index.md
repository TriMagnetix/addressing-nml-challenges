# Fabrication Challenges

## Issues

The primary barrier related to NML fabrication is that it is untested at scale. That being said, the lab-scale prototypes that have been produced primarily use processes that are also used in semiconductor fabrication. [1][1] [2][2] While in theory this means existing semiconductor fabrication sites can be used to produce NML devices, there remains work to be done in proving out the process. A significant obstacle to verifying NML fabrication at scale is certainly the cost given that contemporary ASML EUV machines used in full-scale semiconductor fabrication retail for hundreds of millions of dollars. [3][3] Together, these factors discourage testing NML fabrication at scale, and it will take more than a clever tech demo to convince foundry owners to cede time on their machines.

## Solutions

Without strategic partners in the semiconductor space, testing NML fabrication at scale is an impossible proposition. However, securing even one such partnership and gaining access to their resources could produce enough data to justify broader commitment to NML research. Leading up to this point, it will be important to design more capable and elaborate lab-scale prototypes until access to full EUV systems can be justified.

## Roadmap

In an effort to secure the relationships and resources we need to prove NML fabrication at scale, we plan to:

1. Develop more elaborate lab-scale prototypes to demonstrate initial NML viability
2. Secure a partnership with a University or research institution within the semiconductor space
3. Utilize their resources to further demonstrate NML capabilities
4. Leverage this data to attract a larger player within the space that is willing to cede time on a full EUV machine
5. Demonstrate that NML devices can be fabricated at scale using such semiconductor-compatible resources
