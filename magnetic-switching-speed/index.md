# Magnetic Switching Speed

## Issues

A core concern with nanomagnetic logic devices is whether or not its performance can match semiconductor logic devices. Many contemporary NML systems rely on a clocked external field applied to a region of the device, and this can negatively impact the system's speed in ways that seem to substantiate these concerns. Furthermore, these solutions often require the system to be "blanked out" between clock cycles, which further degrades the overall data throughput. Using these methods at larger scales degrades performance proportional to the size of the system, although component size reduction and localized electrically-induced switching can greatly mitigate such issues.

## Solutions

Contemporary nanomagnetic dot and chain based architectures certainly are subject to the challenges described above, but switching speed has been show to increase in structures with multiple axes of magnetization. Nanomagnetic triangles in particular (which TriMagnetix technology is based on) have been used to achieve picosecond switching speeds that are on-par with competing semiconductor technology. Furthermore, nanomagnetic logic units of all morphologies see their switching speeds and energies decrease as their physical size decreases. Since multi-axial structures can remain stable at nanometer scales, unlike semiconductors, they can further benefit from increased locality and a comparatively lower need for redundancy. These factors together mean that a system of nanomagnetic triangles at such a scale would require fewer components, and the holistic system switching speed would become even more favorable compared to semiconductor counterparts.
