# Thermal Stability

## Overview

Nanomagnetic Logic hinges upon the fact that nanoscale magnets can be aligned, manipulated, and relaxed into a resting state in a reliable and predicable way. As we delve into smaller scales that approach individual electron spins, these properties remain true, although they may become less resilient. Due to a lack of mass, individual spins can be affected by thermal fluctuations that will increase the overall system's error rate.[][1][][2] A similar issue is faced by quantum systems, although mathematical models suggest NML devices may enjoy increased stability with increased locality. [][3]

## Solutions

Although they may affect a systems stability on a sub-atomic scale, thermal fluctuations have been shown to be far less impactful on structures that are on the order of a few nanometers. [][4] Another important consideration is that NML units are incredibly power efficient and generate almost no heat as a result, let alone enough to impact their stability.[][5][][6] Such a low power requirement is owed to the low switching requirement as well as the non-volatility of the system, which removes the requirement for a constant stream of power.[][7] This means that, unlike CMOS and quantum processors, heat management solutions for NML devices can be centered around insulation rather than heat dissipation. To this effect, thermal fluctuations are of relatively little concern while NML devices are deployed in a controlled environment. As for harsh environments such as outer space or in high-heat manufacturing situations, conventional insulation techniques will be sufficient.

## Roadmap

To address the issue of thermal stability in Trimagnetix, we plan to:

1. Utilize thermal-stable permalloys in NML construction
2. Minimize locality with heat-producing integrated circuits
3. Maximize locality within the magnetic lattice itself
4. Insulate against harsh environments using contemporary methods
5. Test Trimagnetix performance in varying thermal conditions to ensure reasonable tolerance
